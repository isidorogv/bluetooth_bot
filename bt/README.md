What is that?
====

A zumo-like robot controlled by means of a bluetooth link. Use this code to your own.

This needs a zumo-like robot and a couple of bluetooth modules. For this test project, HC-05 (master) and HC-06 (slave) modules have been used. It also needs the zumo-shield library to control the zumo motors, and the Softserial library to emulate a serial port in order to allow debuging option.

There are 3 variants to control the robot. Watch the demo videos to note the differences.
