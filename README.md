What is that?
====

A zumo-like robot controlled by means of a bluetooth link. Use this code to your own.

Published under GNU/GPL v3.0 or higher.

This needs a zumo robot and a couple of bluetooth modules. For this test project, HC-05 (master) and HC-06 (slave) modules have been used. It also needs the zumo-shield library to control the zumo motors, and the Softserial library to emulate a serial port in order to allow debuging option.

It performs in two ways, basic and enhanced. Watch the demo videos to note the differences.
