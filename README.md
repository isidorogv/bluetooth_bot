What is that?
====

Code samples to control a zumo-like robot by means of a wireless link. Use this code to your own.

Control shown here can be done in 3 ways: by means of a bluetooth link (HC-05/HC-06 devices) , with a wifi link (ESP module) or using a RF device (nRF24L01). Nowadays there is only code for bluetooth modules. This is a work in progress and the rest of code will be uploaded asap.
